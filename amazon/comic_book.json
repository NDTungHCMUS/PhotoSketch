In 1962, in the pages of a comic book slated for cancellation, Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created one of the most enduring icons in American popular culture: the Amazing Spider-Man! Turning the concept of a super hero on its head, they imbued Peter Parker with the powers of an arachnid and the pressures of an everyday teenager. And the combination was pure magic! Join us as we present Spidey's web-slinging adventures from very beginning: the tragic origin that started it all; the debuts of the Daily Bugle, J. Jonah Jameson, Doctor Octopus, the Sandman, the Vulture and Electro; and guest appearances by the Fantastic Four! And to top it off, we've packed this volume with bonuses galore, including the original artwork to AMAZING FANTASY #15!

    "bookDescription": "In 1986, Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli produced this groundbreaking reinterpretation of the origin of Batman—who he is, and how he came to be. Sometimes careless and naive, this Dark Knight is far from the flawless vigilante he is today. In his first year on the job, Batman feels his way around a Gotham City far darker than the one he left. His solemn vow to extinguish the town’s criminal element is only half the battle; along with Lieutenant James Gordon, the Dark Knight must also fight a police force more corrupt than the scum in the streets.Batman: Year One stands next to Batman: The Dark Knight Returns on the mantle of greatest Batman graphic novels of all time. Timeless in its appeal, Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli’s masterpiece would stand apart from the crowded comics field even today.This edition includes the complete graphic novel, a new introduction by writer Frank Miller and a new illustrated afterword by artist David Mazzucchelli. Completing this collection are over 40 pages of never-before-seen developmental material such as character and layout sketches, sample script pages, sketches, and more that pro-vide a glimpse into the making of this contemporary classic.This volume collects Batman #404-407.",

    "bookDescription": "Leonardo leads, Donatello does machines, Raphael is cool but rude, Michelangelo is a party dude! The animated Turtles of the original cartoon are back!The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles first appeared in 1984, but it wasn’t until 1987 that a catchy theme song and action-packed cartoon helped make them a global phenomenon! Now, in this miniseries, discover four “lost episodes” that follow in the radical two-toed footsteps of the classic animated series.First, an unexpected power surge leaves the brothers trapped in a virtual training program, facing digital versions of their most fearsome foes, in “VR in Deep Trouble”! Next, a mysterious piece of tech transforms one of Krang’s stone soldiers into a power ballad–belting rockstar, but how long will the change last? It’s a hair metal adventure “For Those About to Rock”! Then Casey Jones gets superpowers, and he can’t wait to up his crime-fighting game. But when Raph and the others learn his powers come at a cost, can they convince “Super Casey” to give them up? And finally, when Baxter Stockman injects Splinter with microscopic mousers, Donny will have to shrink himself down to save his sensei, in “Big Trouble in Master Splinter”!Writer Erik Burnham (Ghostbusters, G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero—Saturday Morning Adventures) authentically captures ’80s pop culture so that it holds true for longtime fans while immediately appealing to today’s younger audience, and artist Tim Lattie nails the cartoon’s signature look. Grab a slice and settle in with the world’s most fearsome fighting team, the heroes in a half shell! Cowabunga!",

    "bookDescription": "Sauron has returned. . . watch The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power Season 2 on Prime Video.\nA graphic novel of J.R.R. Tolkien's enchanting prequel to The Lord of the Rings.\nWhen Thorin Oakenshield and his band of dwarves embark upon a dangerous quest to reclaim the hoard of gold stolen from them by the evil dragon Smaug, Gandalf the wizard suggests an unlikely accomplice: Bilbo Baggins, an unassuming Hobbit dwelling in peaceful Hobbiton.\nAlong the way, the company faces trolls, goblins, giant spiders, and worse. But as they journey from the wonders of Rivendell to the terrors of Mirkwood and beyond, Bilbo will find that there is more to him than anyone—himself included—ever dreamed. Unexpected qualities of courage and cunning, and a love of adventure, propel Bilbo toward his great destiny . . . a destiny that waits in the dark caverns beneath the Misty Mountains, where a twisted creature known as Gollum jealously guards a precious magic ring.\nThis comprehensive edition collects the three-issue series originally published by Eclipse Comics and thereafter augmented with many pages of additional artwork and improvements. Carefully abridged from Tolkien’s classic novel, and brought thrillingly to life with striking, evocative art by David Wenzel, this graphic novel is a perennial delight to Hobbit fans old and new.",

    "bookDescription": "The first book collection of the classic and beloved Calvin and Hobbes comic strip!\"Most people who write comic dialogue for minors demonstrate surprisingly little feel for—or faith in—the original source material, that is, childhood, in all its unfettered and winsome glory. It is in this respect that Bill Watterson has proved as unusual as his feckless creations, Calvin and Hobbes. Watterson is the reporter who's gotten it right; childhood as it actually is.\"—Garry Trudeau, from the ForewordThis is the first collection of the classic comic strip that features Calvin, a rambunctious 6-year-old boy, and his stuffed tiger, Hobbes, who comes charmingly to life. Filled with a mix of Watterson’s standard and full-page Sunday strips, this collection is sure to please fans and newcomers alike.",

    "description": "BRING HOME THE FANTASYBirthing the legacy that is Spider-Man, Amazing Fantasy No. 15 introduced the world to Peter Parker and his alter-ego. The legendary web-slinging Spider-Man would later go on to become one of the most recognizable superheroes that the world has ever known. This enamel pin pays tribute to that comic book which has amassed a value of thousands of dollars. Bring home a little bit of the fantasy yourself with this Amazing Fantasy No. 15 Spider-Man pin! AN ESSENTIAL PART OF ANY SPIDER-MAN COLLECTIONWhen it comes to all things Spider-Man, the origins of the superhero would be lost without Amazing Fantasy No. 15. The actual comic, however, is valued at thousands of dollars even for a poor condition one. Debuting at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con, this enamel pin that depicts the front cover of the comic was limited to just 1,000 pieces! One day, this pin may become just as rare as the comic that it's inspired by. Be sure to grab this officially licensed Spider-Man collectible today before they're gone!",

    "bookDescription": "After The Joker’s death, Batman and Gotham City face a mysterious new threat in this direct sequel to Tim Burton’s iconic Batman. The Joker is dead, but not forgotten. Gotham City is saved, but it is still not safe. By night, its new symbol of hope, Batman, continues his fight to protect the innocent and the powerless. By day, his alter ego, Bruce Wayne, wonders whether there may someday be a future beyond skulking the city’s rooftops or the cavernous halls of his stately manor alongside the ever-dutiful Alfred Pennyworth. But even after death, the Clown Prince of Crime’s imprint can be seen in more than just the pavement. Remnants from The Joker’s gang are leading wannabes fascinated by his bizarre mystique on a campaign of arson that threatens the city—even as it serves greedy opportunists, including millionaire Max Shreck. And survivors of exposure to The Joker’s chemical weapon Smylex continue to crowd Gotham City’s main hospital. To quell the chaos, Batman needs more than his cape and his well-stocked Utility Belt. Bruce Wayne is forced into action, prompting a partnership with a charismatic scientist to help solve the health crisis. But as he works in both the shadows and the light, Bruce finds himself drawn deeper into Gotham City’s turmoil than ever before, fueling his obsession to save the city—an obsession that has already driven a wedge between him and Vicki Vale. The loyal Alfred, who had hoped Bruce’s efforts as Batman could help him find closure, finds the opposite happening. Nightmares begin to prompt Bruce to ask new questions about the climactic events in the cathedral, and investigations by Commissioner Gordon and reporter Alexander Knox into the arsons only amplify his concerns. Having told the people of Gotham City that they’d earned a rest from crime, Batman finds the forces of evil growing ever more organized—and orchestrated—by a sinister hand behind the scenes. The World’s Greatest Detective must solve the greatest mystery of all: Could The Joker have somehow survived? And could he still have the last laugh against the people of Gotham City?",

    "bookDescription": "In 1988, Batman readers were allowed to vote on the outcome of the story... and they decided that Robin should die! Jim Starlin's devastating graphic novel classic left shockwaves throughout the comic book industry, many of which are still felt today! As the second person to assume the role of Batman's sidekick, Jason Todd had a completely different personality than the original Robin. Rash and prone to ignore Batman's instructions, Jason was always quick to act without regard to consequences. In this fatal instance, Robin ignores his mentor's warnings when he attempts to take on the Joker by himself and pays the ultimate price. Driven by anger with Superman by his side, Batman seeks his vengeance as he looks to end the Joker's threat forever.This tale of loss, guilt and brutality is considered one of the most defining pieces in the Dark Knight's mythology. Batman: A Death in the Family collects Batman #426-429.",

Tracing the story of the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s rise from his early years as a Baptist minister in Montgomery, AL to his assassination in Memphis, TN in 1968, is riveting storytelling of the highest order, combining first-rate performances with spiritual, political and social themes that remain as relevant today as they were in the era portrayed in the film.
