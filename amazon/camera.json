    "description": "X-H2S offers a powerful and versatile combination of photographic and filmmaking features to enhance any storyteller’s vision. Central to its success are the 26.1-megapixel, back-illuminated X-Trans 5 stacked sensor and X-Processor 5, which combine to provide a 14-stop dynamic range and outstanding performance in all lighting conditions. For motion professionals, there is a wealth of 6.2K 30P full sensor 3:2 recording options, which includes internal 10-bit 4:2:2 Apple ProRes and external Apple ProRes RAW and Blackmagic RAW, all with an electronic shutter capable of making images at 40 frames-per-second, with up to 7-stops of in-body image stabilization, and with an AI-powered advanced autofocus system designed to ensure that performance-seeking stills photographers will also not be disappointed.",
    "features": [
      "X-H2S is the first X Series camera to feature the 26.1-megapixel, X-Trans 5 stacked back-illuminated sensor.

The new X-Processor 5, offers lightning-fast performance for the most demanding situations. Capable of handling vast amounts of data, X-Processor 5 delivers next-level performance enhancements in video and stills processing capabilities and intelligent autofocus functionality that’s 3x faster than Fujifilm’s preceding X-T4 model.",

This delivers unparalleled flexibility within the X Series lineup. Additionally, the ability to record 10-bit 4:2:2 Apple ProRes footage internally to CFexpress Type B memory cards offers incredible post-production flexibility, while the X-Trans 5 sensor’s 14-stop dynamic range optimizes the level of image detail across a uniquely wide exposure range.",
      "The autofocusing system in X-H2S is not only quick, but also highly advanced. Capable of working in light levels down to -7EV and keeping up with both fast and erratically moving subjects, it now features Subject Detection autofocus, utilizing AI to deliver an unmatched autofocus performance. Previous X Series models offer Face and Eye Detection AF, X-H2S’s Subject Detection AF broadens the range of identifiable subjects to further enhance focusing accuracy. The new system can identify and track cars, planes, trains, motorcyclists, birds, horses, dogs, cats and more. Furthermore, face and eye detection capabilities have been expanded to pick up hairlines, glasses, and face coverings.",
      "X-H2S delivers powerful performance, suitable for any professional photographer or filmmaker. Continuous shooting is possible at 15 frames-per-second with the mechanical shutter, and up to 40 frames-per-second when the electronic shutter is deployed.

How long can the recordings be stored? \nDue to its battery-powered design, the camera doesn't support 24/7 continuous recording. It activates recording only when motion is detected.

Connecting it to the router via Ethernet allows the cameras to transmit signals from the homebase, providing wider coverage and a stable connection. \nHow efficient is the solar panel for charging? \nCameras can operate all day after just 2 hours of direct sunlight charging. For best efficiency, position the solar panel in direct sunlight. The panel's charging cable is 3m/10ft long for flexible installation. \nCan I use the homebase for other Aosu cameras? Is it compatible with Apple HomeKit? \nThe Aosu homebase currently supports up to 4 cameras of the same model, not other Aosu products. These cameras are compatible with Alexa and Google Assistant. Support for Apple HomeKit is still in development, so stay tuned for updates.",

It's easy to grip, simple to shoot and water tight. You never have to worry about getting the shot. Waterproof to 15 meters (49 feet). \n4x Optical Zoom \nReady for your Close-up \nThe WPZ2 is tough enough to get you out to where the action is, but sometimes you need a shot that's right in the thick of it all. With 4X Optical Zoom, you can get a close up without ending up in the impact zone. \n16MP BSI CMOS Sensor \nDetail Oriented \n16 megapixels lets you capture lifelike clarity in well defined and detailed images - without losing quality as you alter them later on. Crop, zoom, enlarge and unleash your inner photographer! \n2M Shockproof \nHandles the Hard Knocks \nRigorous activities require tough accessories. If your equipment needs to be able to take a beating, you're in luck with the WPZ2.

    "description": "The super bubbly INSTAX MINI 12™ instant camera Holiday Bundle is bursting with joy, creativity and color. Not only is this iconic instant camera available in a super fun bundle, it’s fully loaded with easy-to-use modes and controls. Designed to keep up with life, the INSTAX MINI 12™ instant camera is ready to go with a simple twist of the lens. Twist again and you’re in Close-up mode, perfect for selfies. Combined with the perfectly positioned selfie mirror, automatic flash control and INSTAX MINI instant photos, the INSTAX MINI 12 instant camera is a selfie extraordinaire. But that’s not all the Close-up mode can do. When activated, the viewfinder neatly pairs up with the lens, so what you see is what you get – no object shifts in your final INSTAX photo! (FYI the fancy term for this is parallax correction.) Because when you’re this close, there’s no room for error. Plus, with automatic exposure, you can simply aim and click. No need to adjust any settings, just simply fun photos every time. And with that in mind, once you have snapped, your INSTAX MINI instant photo will eject in approximately five seconds (development time thereafter is approximately 90 seconds). All without compromising on image quality. That deserves high fives all around. When you’re finished capturing memories, twist the lens again to turn the INSTAX MINI 12 instant camera off. But the fun doesn’t end there. Download the free INSTAX UP!™ App to your Smartphone for a new way to keep all your INSTAX photos digitally, in one place. All you have to do is use the INSTAX UP! App and your Smartphone to scan your printed INSTAX photos and they’ll be turned into sharable, digital photos that you can edit, tag and save. Ready to twist & go? Get the most out of your INSTAX MINI 12 instant camera with these great accessories included in the bundle. Bundle Includes one 10 pack of INSTAX MINI white border instant film to capture lasting memories, one 20pk INSTAX MINI film border stickers, an INSTAX MINI Photo Album to hold up to 64 prints of your INSTAX MINI precious moments, INSTAX Faux Fur Drawstring Pouch that conveniently holds a Mini 12 camera & pack of film and an INSTAX Photo Idea Booklet to let your imagination run wild with creative projects to create using printed INSTAX photos.",
